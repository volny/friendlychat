# Firebase Friendly Chat

## A real-time chat app with notifications using Firebase.

Based on [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#0)

### Browser support

[`Push API` is supported by Chrome and Firefox, so you will need to use one of these browsers for notifications to work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38152122/does-firebase-cloud-messaging-support-all-major-browsers-or-just-chrome).
Also Firebase auth relies on 3rd-party cookies, so if you've disabled them in the privacy settings of your browser you will not be able to log in.
